# bench_example
Example run directory for a CABLE benchmark.

In `config.yaml` please change:
 - the NCI user
 - the NCI project
 - the names of the branches to run to correspond to your case

Do not remove configurations from `site_configs.yaml`. But you can add new configurations if you like. 

It takes just over 2 hours to run this example configuration.
